Changes to MF2005 main and GWF2BAS7 to accommodate the capability for
Time Step Advance (AD) routines to adjust the number of time steps in
a stress period.

1.  In DIS data, allow the number of time steps (NSTP) to be negative
for a stress period.  A negative value signifies that time steps are
adjustable, with the maximum number of steps being the absolute value
of NSTP.

2.  A new global array, ISTPADJ(NPER), is created to indicate the use of
adjustable time steps.  ISTPADJ is 0 for nonadjustable time steps, and
NSTP is the number of time steps as usual.  ISTPADJ is 1 for adjustable
time steps, and NSTP is the maximum number of time steps in the stress
period.

3.  Add variable LASTTS to Global data.  LASTTS is 1 for the last time
step of a stress period and 0 for other time steps.  BAS7ST sets
LASTTS=0.  BAS7AS sets LASTTS=1 when KSTP=NSTP.

4.  In the main, add the statement

     IF(LASTTS.NE.0) GO TO 100

just before the end of the time step DO Loop.  This will allow VDF or
other code to specify that a stress period ends before NSTP.

5.  Output control has been modified to allow two new forms of the
PERIOD n STEP n record.

    PERIOD 0 STEP 0

indicates that the output specified in subsequent records will occur
every time step.

    PERIOD n STEP 0

indicates that output specified in subsequent records will occur at the
end of stress period n.  The last time step is indicated by the LASTTS
flag.
